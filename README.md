It includes a Map for finding and navigation between locations in the Charlottesville area, as well as showing additional information that can be found by clicking on buildings that are in the UVA buildings database. Additionally, users can share about their experiences with buildings on Grounds with the Forum feature, and add events to their own personal schedule to help them find and navigate to all of their classes. All features can be accessed after logging in with a Google account.

These locations can be clicked and dragged on the map to change the directions. Different directions and locations can also be found using the search bar within the map page. For each trip, different directions for several forms of different forms of transportation can be accessed to account for all modes od getting around Grounds. Additionally, clicking on UVA buildings on the map will bring up additional information on that building thanks to the UVA Building API.
