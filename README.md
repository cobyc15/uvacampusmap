# UVA CS3240 Group B-04 Campus-Map Project

__Deployment Link:__ [UVACampusMap](https://uvacampusmap.herokuapp.com/)

## Project Info
This project is meant to be a Campus Map for once UVA students are back at Grounds after the COVID-19 pandemic. It includes a Map for search and navigation between locations in the Charlottesville area, as well as showing additional information for UVA buildings. Additionally, users can share about their experiences about being on Grounds with the Forum feature, and add events to their own personal schedule to help them find and navigate to all of their classes. All features can be accessed after logging in with a Google account.

## Major Features
### Map and Navigation
Implemented using the MapBox API, this feature is meant to help users find locations they wish to go to in the UVA/Charlottesvile area. Clicking on two different locations on the map will bring up instructions to get from the first one clicked to the second. These locations can be clicked and dragged on the map to change the directions. Different directions and locations can also be found using the search bar within the map page. For each trip, different directions for several forms of different forms of transportation can be accessed to account for all modes of getting around Grounds. Additionally, clicking on UVA buildings on the map will bring up additional information on that building thanks to the UVA Building API.

### Forum and Community Calendar
Once logged in, users can use the Forum feature to discuss their experiences with locations on Grounds and any potential difficulties finding or navigating them, or anything else they want to share. They can view posts already made by just their title, read their contents by clicking on them, or make a post of their own by clicking the "New Post" button. Posts each have a timestamp of when they were made as well as the author of the post that can be seen when they are expanded. Additionally, events that are affecting all users are displayed in the Calendar tab of this page, and can be seen either on this calendar page or on the "Home" page of the Forum if one is upcoming. 

### Personal Profile and Schedule
Using the navigation bar, users can also view information about their own profile. They can see what their name is to other users if they were to post to the Forum, the email used for login, and when they first started using the site. Users each have their own schedule that only they can see and add events to. They can add events such as their classes and include information such as the title, time, location, and description of the event. When doing so, they can consult the Community Calendar directly or see the location of the event that they are adding to check. From here, if a user has added events to their personal calendar or made posts to the Forum, they will be able to see these on their profile page and the additionally information they added when making the post or event.
